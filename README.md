## Introduction
Developed and verified a `Deep Learning` model for predicting the risk of death in ICU patients. Because the traditional regression model predicts mortality rate based on a simplified relationship between predictor variables and prognosis, it is difficult to improve the predictive ability of that model. Therefore, based on the strong nonlinear fitting ability and more precise algorithms of deep learning, I constructed a neural-network model for predicting the survival rate of patients in the ICU's and explored the influencing patient factors.

## ðŸ§¾ Description: 
Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patientâ€™s overall health has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system. Knowledge about chronic conditions can inform clinical decisions about patient care and ultimately improve patient's survival outcomes.
